# Cursor Configuration for Xavier Framework

You are working on Indie Campers projects using the Xavier AI agent framework.

## Primary Configuration
Follow the instructions in `CLAUDE.md` at the repository root. That file contains the complete framework configuration optimized for Claude Code but also applicable to Cursor.

## Quick Reference

### Available Agents
Use @mentions to engage specialists:
- @product-partner - Requirements and user stories
- @tech-lead - Architecture and technical decisions
- @backend-engineer - APIs and backend services
- @frontend-engineer - UI/UX with Next.js/React
- @data-analytics-engineer - Data pipelines and analytics
- @qa-release - Testing and deployment

### Project Context
Key documentation in `docs/ai/`:
- `project-overview.md` - Business context
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology inventory
- `working-agreements.md` - Team conventions
- `current-work.md` - Active work tracking

### Workflow
1. Understand requirements (intake-and-clarify)
2. Plan implementation (plan-and-slice)
3. Write code (code-change-protocol)
4. Test thoroughly (testing-protocol)
5. Create PR (pr-description-protocol)

### Tech Stack Summary
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js 20, Next.js API routes, Cloudflare Workers
- Database: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS/Supabase), Cloudflare D1
- Auth: Logto SSO
- Deploy: Docker/AWS ECS, Cloudflare Workers/Pages

### Key Principles
- Small PRs (<400 lines)
- Document assumptions in `current-work.md`
- Test manually when automation unavailable
- Consider multi-depot scenarios
- Follow conventional commits
